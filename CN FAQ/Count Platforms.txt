hey 


so basically we have to find min no of platforms so that no train collide == max no of trains on station at any time 


say we take a variable counter to keep track of trains on station 

so initially no train at platform so counter =0;


now we have arrival and departure time of trains 


we will put them all in a vector where each entry in vector is pair st {Time, arrival or departure} 


where pair first will give value of time and second will tell wheter its departure or arrival 


sort these vector on the basis of time  and now traverse this vector 


if train comes add 1  to counter and if train departs then deduct 1 from counter 


so our ans will be max value of counter obtained during traversing of the vector


see this for more clarification 


arr[]  = {9:00,  9:40, 9:50,  11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
    dep[]  = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}

All events sorted by time.
Total platforms at any time can be obtained by subtracting total 
departures from total arrivals by that time.
 Time     Event Type     Total Platforms Needed at this Time                               
 9:00       Arrival                  1
 9:10       Departure                0
 9:40       Arrival                  1
 9:50       Arrival                  2
 11:00      Arrival                  3 
 11:20      Departure                2
 11:30      Departure                1
 12:00      Departure                0
 15:00      Arrival                  1
 18:00      Arrival                  2 
 19:00      Departure                1
 20:00      Departure                0

Minimum Platforms needed on railway station = Maximum platforms 
                                              needed at any time 
                                           = 3
