hey its kind of difficult for me to explain its logic 


So i am sending u psuedo code for the same 


and try running it on few examples 


and u will understand how it works 



rightIdx = 0

getDepth(str,a,Idx)
    rightIdx++
	if a is 'l' then return 0 
	Ld = getDepth(str,str[Idx+1],Idx+1)
	Rd = getDepth(str,str[rightIdx],rightIdx)
	return 1+max(Ld,Rd)


paste it on IDE for proper indentation 


from depth we make initial call


    		return getDepth(str,str[0],0)


reopen if req :)
